<p>
  The primary functionality of Beacon is to expose ports for dedicated server applications (such as
  game servers). All related options are directly available from the primary application window:
</p>

<p>
  <img alt="Main Window" src="{{ '/media/docs/usage_port-forwarding_layout.png' | relative_url }}"/>
</p>

<p>
  The window consists of the following three primary components:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Service List</strong> - This list displays all applications for which port definitions
    are provided
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Service Actions</strong> - The open and close port actions will appear here
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Port List</strong> - This list displays all ports for a selected application
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>External Address</strong> - This is the IP address at which exposed applications will
    become available
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 class="ui header">Step by Step</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Start the server (a dedicated Minecraft Server, for instance)
  </li>
  <li>
    Select an application ("Minecraft: Java Edition", for instance) from the service list on the
    left
  </li>
  <li>
    Select "Open Ports"
  </li>
  <li>
    Copy the external address ("10.42.42.1" in the example above) and forward it to your
    friends/family/etc (whoever you wish to let into your server)
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>(Optional)</em> Minimize the application (By default, it will appear in your system
    tray (see below) and may be restored via double click)
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>(Optional)</em> Once you are done playing, press the "Close Ports" button
  </li>
</ol>

  <div class="header">Important</div>
  Beacon needs to remain running while ports are exposed. Closing the application will also close
  all previously opened ports.
</div>

<h2 class="ui header">System Tray</h2>

<p>
  Unless explicitly disabled, Beacon will place itself within your System Tray when minimized. It will
  remain running in the background and keep your ports open within this mode. In order to restore it,
  double click the Beacon icon.
</p>

<div class="ui centered grid">
  <div class="eight wide column">
    <img alt="System Tray (Simple)"
         src="{{ '/media/docs/usage_port-forwarding_tray-simple.png' | relative_url }}"/>

  <div class="eight wide column">
    <img alt="System Tray (Extended)"
         src="{{ '/media/docs/usage_port-forwarding_tray-extended.png' | relative_url }}"/>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This functionality can be disabled within the application settings.</p>

  By default, Beacon will be hidden within the extended Tray Menu (accessible through the up arrow
  located directly next to the tray area). If desired, this may be changed via the
  <code>Taskbar Settings</code> menu.
