<p>
  In addition to the stock port lists, custom services may be defined and stored locally in order
  to permit exposure of unsupported applications as well as customized port ranges:
</p>

<p>
  <img alt="Main Window"
       src="{{ '/media/docs/usage_custom-service-layout-main.png' | relative_url }}"/>
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Add Service</strong> - Opens the editor for a new custom service</li>
  <li><strong>Edit Service</strong> - Opens the editor for an existing service</li>
  <li><strong>Remove Service</strong> - <em>Permanently</em> deletes a service</li>
</ol>

<p>
  When creating or editing a service, the following view is presented:
</p>

<p>
  <img alt="Service Window"
       src="{{ '/media/docs/usage_custom-service-layout-service.png' | relative_url }}"/>
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Service Name</strong> - User specified display name for this service (non empty)</li>
  <li><strong>Port List</strong> - Displays previously created ports</li>
  <li><strong>Add Port</strong> - Opens the port editor for a new port</li>
  <li><strong>Remove Port</strong> - <em>Permanently</em> removes the selected port</li>
</ol>

<p>
  New ports are created via the port editor:
</p>

<p>
  <img alt="Port Window"
       src="{{ '/media/docs/usage_custom-service-layout-port.png' | relative_url }}"/>
</p>

<p>
  Each port is specified by a protocol (either TCP or UDP) and a port number. For more information
  on which port and protocol to select, refer to your respective server's documentation.
</p>

<h2 class="ui header">Step by Step</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Select "Add Service" from the main application window</li>
  <li>Enter a descriptive name (such as "Minecraft (Custom Port)")</li>
  <li>Select "Add Port"</li>
  <li>
    Select the target protocol (either TCP or UDP) according to your server software
    documentation
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter the port number according to your server software documentation and custom settings
  </li>
  <li>
    Select "Save"
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>(Optional)</em> Repeat steps 3-6 as often as necessary
  </li>
  <li>Select "Save"</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Once these steps are completed, your service will be listed in the "Custom" section in the main
  application window as usual.

  Even if the port numbers match, TCP and UDP ports must be created separately. As such, a game
  running on port <code>25565</code> on both TCP and UDP requires a mapping for
  <code>TCP/25565</code> as well as <code>UDP/25565</code>. Refer to your server's documentation for
  additional information.
