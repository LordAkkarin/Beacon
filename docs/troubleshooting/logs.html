<p>
  Sometimes you may be asked to acquire the application logs for further debugging and tracing of
  issues. Beacon writes these logs to a special directory on your system disk by default. The
  logs are typically stored within the following paths (in accordance with yoru respective
  operating system):
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Windows</strong> - <code>%APPDATA%\Beacon\log</code></li>
  <li><strong>*NIX</strong> - <code>/home/&lt;user&gt;/.beacon/log</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
  Typically, these paths may be accessed simply via your respective system's file explorer.
</p>

<p>
  Log files are split per application launch (thus causing multiple files to be present within the
  directory in most cases). The latest (or current) application launch will <em>always</em> write
  its log messages into the file titled <code>latest.log</code>. Older launches are stored within
  the files titled <code>lantern.log.1</code> through <code>lantern.log.10</code>. Please refer to
  the modification dates when asked to provide older logs.

<p>
  If the application starts up as expected (e.g. you can get to the Main Window and all following
  screens within the following steps), you may simply access the logs as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select "Settings"</li>
  <li>Select "Troubleshooting" in the sidebar on the left</li>
  <li>"Select "Show Logs"</li>
</ol>

<p>
  This should result in a file explorer window opening at the location of the log files. If this
  is not the case, please verify that your system's file explorer has been configured properly.
</p>

{% capture file_not_found_info %}
  <div class="ui info message">
    <div class="header">Regarding "No such directory" errors</div>
    If, for any reason, your file explorer reports that the given path does not exist on the
    filesystem, this most commonly indicates a launch failure related to your Java installation.
    Please refer to the Java Troubleshooting section in this case.

<p>
  If the application fails to launch or crashes prior to reaching the troubleshooting menu, you may
  also access the logs directly via your system's file explorer.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Launch a File Explorer at any location (for instance, your documents or user directory)</li>
  <li>
    Click the address bar (which should currently be displaying the location of the chosen initial
    directory)
  </li>
  <li>Enter <code>%APPDATA%\Beacon\log</code></li>
</ol>

<p>
  Similarly to the normal access path, your file explorer should now display all prior log files.

  <li>
    Navigate to your home directory (typically <code>/home/&lt;user&gt;</code>; may also be
    accessible via a dedicated shortcut)
  </li>
  <li>If there is no directory called <code>.beacon</code>, press <code>Ctrl + H</code></li>
  <li>Enter the <code>.beacon</code> directory</li>
